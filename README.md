# NASA Space Mission AI Project - Conceptual Design Track

## Project Overview
**Student Name**: Andrew Kuruvilla
**Course**: ITAI 2372  
**Project Name**: Andrew_Kurvilla_Conceptual_Design_Track
**Track**: Conceptual Design Track  

This repository contains the conceptual design for an AI-based solution for a NASA space mission. The project focuses on designing an autonomous navigation system for a Mars rover, leveraging AI techniques such as machine learning and sensor fusion to optimize path planning and obstacle avoidance.

## Project Structure
- **docs/**: Contains the project proposal, detailed solution plan, and testing plan.
- **NASA-Space-Mission-AI-Project-Plan.pdf/**: Contains the final presentation slides (PDF).
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## How to Read the Documentation
